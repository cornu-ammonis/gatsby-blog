I am a scientist by training and Javascript developer by trade. Find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-jones-711998151/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/cornu-ammonis).

I am constantly learning on the job as I've been lucky enough to hire engineers more senior than myself. This blog will catalogue and reinforce some of those learnings, with a particular emphasis on React / CSS best practices and demos of React components I've built.
